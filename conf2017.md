## Save the date - 7-8 September 2017

Following the [success](https://www.software.ac.uk/blog/2016-10-04-future-rses-looking-rosy-following-phenomenal-conference) of the [First Conference of Research Software Engineers](http://www.rse.ac.uk/conf2016), we are pleased to announce that the Second Conference will be held at the Museum of Science and Industry at Manchester on the 7-8 September 2017. As for the First Conference, we are expecting an international mix of over 200 attendees, and a programme full of interesting talks, discussion sessions and practical workshops.

## Calls for Talks, Discussion Workshops and Practical Workshops

We anticipate releasing the calls for Talks, Discussion Workshops and Practical workshop in mid March 2017. The format will likely be very similar to the calls for the [First Conference](http://www.rse.ac.uk/conf2016_calls). Please check back here in March for more details.

## Registration

We anticipate opening registration for attendees in June 2017. The conference was [heavily oversubscribed](https://www.software.ac.uk/blog/2016-10-04-future-rses-looking-rosy-following-phenomenal-conference) last year, so we encourage you to register early to avoid disappointment. We will announce the date of opening registration nearer the time, via this website, the UKRSE mailing list, the UKRSE Slack group and Twitter (using hashtag #RSE17).

## Sponsorship

We are very grateful for the [companies that sponsored](http://www.rse.ac.uk/conf2016_sponsors) the First Conference, and who helped make it such a success. With over 200 attendees from 14 countries, sponsorship provided both significant exposure, and more importantly, a good opportunity for companies and organisations to connect with Research Software Engineers from around the World. 

From [feedback](https://www.software.ac.uk/blog/2016-10-19-rse-conference-feedback-what-did-people-think), 95% of attendees of the First Conference said they would attend again, with 100% saying they would recommend the conference to others. The Second Conference will therefore be bigger and better. If you are interested in partnering with us to provide sponsorship, please [get in touch](mailto:Christopher.Woods@bristol.ac.uk). We will be offering different levels of sponsorship, and are happy to talk with you about how we can work together to make the Second Conference a success.
