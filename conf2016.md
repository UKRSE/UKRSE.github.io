## Information for conference attendees

If you are attending the conference and are taking part in the practical workshops (A1-A4, B1-B4, C1-C4 - [see here for the workshops you are attending](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B_KkGMZ8ACfaYjNhM3lMbmhUVUk/view)), you will need to **bring a laptop** that has VirtualBox installed. For more information about requirements, please [click here](conf2016_instructions).

The RSE Conference (15-16 September) is the first conference to focus exclusively on the issues that affect people who write and use software in research. It is not a standard academic conference! We welcome researchers, but we also want to hear from people who may not typically attend conferences. It’s a community conference: get involved and help us build the RSE Community.

**The conference will be held at the [Museum of Science and Industry, in Manchester, UK](conf2016_venue). More information about this venue and how to get there is [available on this page](conf2016_venue).**

## What’s an RSE?

Research Software Engineers are the people who work in research, but write code not papers. Most people who conduct the work of an RSE are not formally called a Research Software Engineer. 

Are you an RSE? [Read this page for more information](http://www.rse.ac.uk/who.html).

## Who should take part?

We’re looking for participation from anyone with an interest in software in research: people who develop software (regardless of your job title), researchers, people who provide tools. It doesn’t matter if you’ve never attended a conference before, if you have an interest in software, we want to hear from you!

We’re actively encouraging first-time speakers and workshop leaders to take part, and we’re offering support and mentoring to those people who would like it.

## Attend!

Attendees will learn about the cutting edge techniques being used in research, pick up new skills, and hear from a broad range of speakers.

## UKRSE AGM

We will also be holding the UKRSE Annual General Meeting during the conference. This is your chance to influence the community through discussions, voting or standing for an official role.

We will circulate more details about the AGM nearer the time.

## Poster Competition

Thanks to our [sponsors](conf2016_sponsors), we are pleased to announce that we will be hosting a poster competition at the conference, with 
prizes available for the best posters.

The poster competition is open to students or early career researchers (or equivalent) who have registered to attend the conference. 
If you would like more details [click here](conf2016_posters).

## Sponsorship

For the first time, we’re getting together people from across the UK (and beyond) who develop and use research software.  We’re looking for sponsors to help us increase participation by keeping registration fees low.

We have various levels of sponsorship, each of which is associated with different benefits. For more information, visit [our sponsorship page](conf2016_sponsors).
