# 2016 RSE Conference

The RSE Conference is the first conference to focus exclusively on the issues that affect people who write and use software in research. It is not a standard academic conference! We welcome researchers, but we also want to hear from people who may not typically attend conferences. Itâ€™s a community conference: get involved and help us build the RSE Community.

It will be held at the [Museum of Science and Industry, Manchester](http://msimanchester.org.uk/) on September 15-16 2016. For more information, please visit [the conference website](conf2016).
