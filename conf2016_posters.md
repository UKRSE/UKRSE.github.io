## Poster Presentations	

Thanks to our [sponsors](conf2016_sponsors), we are pleased to announce that we will be hosting a poster competition at the conference, with 
prizes available for the best posters.

The poster competition is open to students or early career researchers (or equivalent) who have registered to attend the conference. If you would like 
to submit an application to present a poster, please fill in the form below.

Posters will be on permanent display during the two days of the conference, with poster sessions available during the coffee and lunch
breaks. Posters will be crowd-judged by attendees during the conference, with prizes awarded during the wrap up talk on 
[Friday afternoon](conf2016_friday).

The deadline for submission will be **10pm on Friday 19th August**. We will evaluate the submissions and will notify you of the outcome
during the week of the 15th August.
