## Conference Dinner

We are happy to announce that the conference dinner will be held at the [BlackDog New Wakefield Street](http://blackdogballroom.co.uk/nws/) in Manchester between 7.00pm-9.00pm. The cost of the dinner is included for free with your registration.

BlackDog is a New York style speakeasy, diner with a pool room, roof terrace BBQ and basement bar and club. We will be providing both food and drink.

Please note that all dietary requirements will be catered for, but make sure that you have let us know beforehand when you registered. The relaxed buffet style meal will comprise a selection of pizza, mixed fries, pulled pork sliders and nachos, with additional food available provided via a barbeque.

The relaxed buffet style venue should make socialising and networking both fun and relaxing, and the night promises to be a great chance to get to know your fellow RSEs.

BlackDog is located adjacent to Manchester Oxford Road train station, is located 0.7 miles (about 15 minutes walk) from the conference venue (as seen in the map below). We cannot pay for or arrange transport to or from the venue. However, we will facilitate grouping people together so that you can travel to and from the venue in groups (e.g. shared taxis).
