      <h2 class="h-ukrse">What is a Research Software Engineer?</h2>
      <div class="row-fluid">
        <div class="col-ukrse col-xs-12 col-sm-6 col-md-6 col-lg-6">
          <p class="text-justify"><b>A growing number of people in academia combine expertise in programming with an intricate understanding of research. Although this combination of skills is extremely valuable, these people lack a formal place in the academic system. This means there is no easy way top recognise their contribution, to reward them, or to represent their views.</b><br><br>
Without a name, it is difficult for people to rally around a cause, so we created the term Research Software Engineer. We are now working to raise awareness of the role and bring the community together.<br><br>
Some Research Software Engineers start off as researchers who spend time developing software to progress their research. Because they enjoy this work and have invested in developing specialist skills, they continue to focus on software and its use in research. Others start off from a more conventional software-development background and are drawn to research by the challenge of using software to further research.<br><br>
The <a href="http://www.software.ac.uk/blog/2013-08-23-ten-reasons-be-research-software-engineer">attraction of being a Research Software Engineer</a> is similar to those of being a researcher: the role attracts people who want to know how the world works. The Research Software Engineer works with researchers to gain an understanding of the problems they face, and then develops, maintains and extends software to provide the answers.</p>

          <h4 class="h-ukrse">Are you a Research Software Engineer?</h4>
          <p class="text-justify">Regardless of your formal job title, if you answer yes to many of the following questions, you are doing the work of a Research Software Engineer:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>Are you employed to develop software for research?</li>
            <li>Are you spending more time developing software than conducting research?</li>
            <li>Are you employed as a postdoctoral researcher, even though you predominantly work on software development?</li>
            <li>Are you the <i>person who does computers</i> in your research group?</li>
            <li>Are you sometimes not named on research papers despite playing a fundamental part in developing the software used to create them?</li>
            <li>Do you lack the metrics needed to progress your academic career, like papers and conference presentations, despite having made a significant contribution through software?</li>

      <div class="row-fluid">
        <div class="col-ukrse col-xs-12 col-sm-12 col-md-12 col-lg-12">
          <p class="text-justify"><b>If the UK is to continue to be a major research leader, effort and resources must be invested into nurturing our community of Research Software Engineers. Without them, the software used in research will fail to meet the demands of researchers.</b><br><br>
It is impossible to get the best out of research software if the people behind that software are not recognised and rewarded. Although most people enter the career because of a passion for applying their skills to challenging research problems, this cannot sustain a long-term career. After working in academia, many Research Software Engineers move to industry which highly values their expertise. It’s academia’s role to provide a highly skilled workforce for industry, but it’s also vital for the UK’s research economy to keep some Research Software Engineers working in academia.</p>

          <h4 class="h-ukrse">Join the community!</h4>
          <p class="text-justify">By <a href="#joinus">joining the community</a>, you will receive updates about our work, information about events and the ability to raise questions with people like you from across academia (and absolutely zero spam). The more members that we have, the easier it will be to prove the impact of the Research Software Engineering community.</p>
          <br>

          <h4 class="h-ukrse">Raise awareness</h4>
          <p class="text-justify">You can raise our <a href="#objectives">objectives</a> at your local developers or hackers group, and if you don’t have a local group, you can set up a local RSE Community for your organisation. Local groups get together to share knowledge and expertise, and they are a useful way of gaining recognition from your organisation. Contact us for more details about setting up a local group.</p>
          <br>

          <h4 class="h-ukrse">Attend and organise events</h4>
          <p class="text-justify">You can help us to organise events. We will be running regular workshops to get Research Software Engineers together for discussion and collaboration. We want to hold workshops across the UK, so we need your local knowledge. We need people to talk about their work, to organise training or mentoring at events, to help us organise and run the events and to help us publicise them to the Research Software Engineers Community.</p>
          <br>

          <h4 class="h-ukrse">Help us organise</h4>
          <p class="text-justify">You can join the Research Software Engineers Committee. The first committee was set up to get the community started, but we now want to broaden the committee and get more members from across the UK and across disciplines. If you want to help steer the way the community grows, and you can spare a couple of hours every couple of months, we want to hear from you.</p>
          <br>

          <h4 class="h-ukrse">Partner organisations, campaigners and industry</h4>
          <p class="text-justify">If your organisation benefits from Research Software Engineers, we need your help. We need partners who are willing to raise awareness about the Research Software Engineer role with all sections of the research community. We also need help, resources and funds to run workshops and other events. Please contact us to find out more.</p>
