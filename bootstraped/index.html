      The people behind research software - Research Software Engineers (RSEs) - lack recognition and reward for the incredible contribution they make to research.

	  <b>A growing number of people in academia combine expertise in programming with an intricate understanding of research. Although this combination of skills is extremely valuable, these people lack a formal place in the academic system. This means there is no easy way top recognise their contribution, to reward them, or to represent their views.</b><br>
          <br>
Without a name, it is difficult for people to rally around a cause, so we created the term Research Software Engineer. We are now working to raise awareness of the role and bring the community together.<br>
          <br>
Some Research Software Engineers start off as researchers who spend time developing software to progress their research. Because they enjoy this work and have invested in developing specialist skills, they continue to focus on software and its use in research. Others start off from a more conventional software-development background and are drawn to research by the challenge of using software to further research.<br>
          <br>
          The <a href="http://www.software.ac.uk/blog/2013-08-23-ten-reasons-be-research-software-engineer">attraction of being a Research Software Engineer</a> is similar to those of being a researcher: the role attracts people who want to know how the world works. The Research Software Engineer works with researchers to gain an understanding of the problems they face, and then develops, maintains and extends software to provide the answers.

          <p class="text-justify">
          Regardless of your formal job title, if you answer yes to many of the following questions, you are doing the work of a Research Software Engineer:
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>Are you employed to develop software for research?</li>
            <li>Are you spending more time developing software than conducting research?</li>
            <li>Are you employed as a postdoctoral researcher, even though you predominantly work on software development?</li>
            <li>Are you the <i>person who does computers</i> in your research group?</li>
            <li>Are you sometimes not named on research papers despite playing a fundamental part in developing the software used to create them?</li>
            <li>Do you lack the metrics needed to progress your academic career, like papers and conference presentations, despite having made a significant contribution through software?</li>

          <b>If the UK is to continue to be a major research leader, effort and resources must be invested into nurturing our community of Research Software Engineers. Without them, the software used in research will fail to meet the demands of researchers.</b><br>
          <br>
It is impossible to get the best out of research software if the people behind that software are not recognised and rewarded. Although most people enter the career because of a passion for applying their skills to challenging research problems, this cannot sustain a long-term career. After working in academia, many Research Software Engineers move to industry which highly values their expertise. It’s academia’s role to provide a highly skilled workforce for industry, but it’s also vital for the UK’s research economy to keep some Research Software Engineers working in academia.

          You can join the Research Software Engineers Committee. The first committee was set up to get the community started, but we now want to broaden the committee and get more members from across the UK and across disciplines. If you want to help steer the way the community grows, and you can spare a couple of hours every couple of months, we want to hear from you.

          <b>The Research Software Engineer campaign started life at a <a href="http://www.software.ac.uk/community/workshops">Collaborations Workshop</a> in 2012, which was organised by the <a href="http://www.software.ac.uk/">Software Sustainability Institute</a> (an EPSRC-funded organisation).</b><br>
          <br>
The Software Sustainability Institute’s mission is to improve the situation of software in research. Bringing together a community of Research Software Engineers and campaigning for their recognition and reward will have a huge impact on the quality and esteem of software in research, so the Institute agreed to provide some funds and effort to kickstart the community, and to campaign on its behalf.<br>
          <br>
Success for the Research Software Engineer campaign is far more likely if the community becomes self supporting and independent. For this reason, the Software Sustainability Institute will continue to support the community and campaign for Research Software Engineers, but the community will be steered by a committee made up of Research Software Engineers.

          If you want be a part of the community, come to our AGM and hackday which takes place on 15-16 September at King’s College London. It’s a free event thanks to our sponsor <a href="http://www.maudsleylearning.com/about-maudsley-learning/">Maudsley Digital</a>.<br>
          <br>
          Back in March 2012, we began raising awareness of the research community’s reliance on RSEs. In the last last year, we have made excellent progress in gaining recognition for RSEs. In the coming year, we want to continue this work, and attract more people to the community so that we have the weight of numbers to change how academia deals with its software developers.<br>
          <br>
          </p>
          <h4 class="h-ukrse">Register now!</h4>
          <p class="text-justify">
          There are only 80 places available at the AGM and 60 at the hackday. If you want to attend, please <a href="https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/rse-agm-and-hackday-tickets-12457236931">register now</a>.<br>
          <br>
          The AGM and Hackday will take place at <a href="http://www.maudsleylearning.com/the-ortus/">Ortus</a>, which is based at King’s College London on 15 and 16 September 2014. More details are available on the <a href="https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/rse-agm-and-hackday-tickets-12457236931">registration page</a>.<br>
          <br>
          You can elect to attend either the AGM, the hackday or both events!<br>
          <br>
          </p>
          <h4 class="h-ukrse">The AGM</h4>
          <p class="text-justify">
          The AGM will feature various sessions designed to bring RSEs together, to swap expertise and to discuss how we can improve the situation of RSEs in academia The technology showcase provides you with time to discuss technology that you’ve developed, or just a technology that you like to use. Training sessions let you pass on expertise that you’ve developed to other RSEs. Finally, discussion groups let us pick your brains about issues that affect the RSE community so that we can better represent those views to research stakeholders.<br>
          <br>
          </p>
          <h4 class="h-ukrse">The Hackday</h4>
          <p class="text-justify">
          In collaboration with our sponsor, Maudsley Digital, we will run a hackday on 16 September which will focus on how activity data can be used to help understand and diagnose mental health issues.<br>
          <br>
          We will provide activity data and monitors, cloud resources, food, coffee and - of course - plenty of RSEs to hack with. We’ll be asking clinicians to provide some pointers about the help that they need, but what you work on will be completely up to you. The best hacks will not only receive prizes, but will also get the chance to engage with Maudsley Digital to ensure that their work can be used to help the community.<br>
          <br>
          </p>
          <h4 class="h-ukrse">The Elections</h4>
          <p class="text-justify">
          If the RSE Community is to last, it should be self-governing. For this reason, we will soon be holding elections for places on the committee that organises the community. The people who are interested in running the community will get the opportunity to present a lightning talk about why you should vote for them.<br>
          <br>
          </p>
          <h4 class="h-ukrse">Thanks to our Sponsors!</h4>
