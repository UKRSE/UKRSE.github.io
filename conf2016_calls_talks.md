## Call for Talks

The first conference for Research Software Engineers invites applications to present a talk and write an accompanying paper on a topic of interest to research software engineers and academic software developers.

20 talks will be presented during the conference, each lasting 15 minutes with an additional 5 minutes for questions. They will be held in three sessions with four talks running in parallel (see [the programme](http://www.rse.ac.uk/conf2016_programme)). Attendees will have a choice of which of the parallel talk sessions they wish to attend.

The papers will be published in a special edition of the [Journal of Open Research Software](http://openresearchsoftware.metajnl.com/).

## What we’re looking for

We’re looking for talks that discuss and expand on issues that affect RSEs. You could announce a new code, discuss the application of a technology in a new context, or describe a technique that could be applied more widely.

We’re also interested in other topics related to software in research and how it is developed - from non-technical skills RSEs need to cultural issues our community must address. Personal experiences are welcome if you can make them relevant to the audience.

These are just a few examples though. We hope to get some suggestions that surprise us! This is the first ever RSE conference so you tell us what should be covered and why it’s important.

## Selection Criteria:

* Interest to the research community
* Novelty: the majority of the audience won’t find it obvious
* Ability to improve research or help the research community

## Who should apply

All sorts of people who have an interesting take on research software development:

* Researchers at any career stage who program
* Software developers working in a research context, whatever their job title or department
* People from any organisation that provide tools, platforms or services of interest to RSEs

We’re aiming for a well-balanced programme that includes talks from a wide variety of perspectives to reflect the diversity of the community and it’s activities. We are not just looking for seasoned speakers or people who are already well known.

## First-time speaker?

**We want you to talk! It’s important that the program includes people who don’t normally publish papers or attend academic conferences or we’ll be missing whole sections of the RSE community.**

**It’s not intimidating. The emphasis is on learning from each other in a supportive atmosphere. Your perspective is welcome and this will be a great chance to start a wider discussion of issues you care about.**

**We can help. We can offer mentoring and other support with preparing your talk - just ask.**

## How to submit a proposal

The initial application is via [this simple form](http://goo.gl/forms/jUywhxFMPy) where you can submit an abstract and answer some brief questions about how your proposed talk meets our selection criteria 

## Questions?
We’re happy to talk through your ideas before you fill in the form. Just email [Simon Hettrick](mailto:S.Hettrick@software.ac.uk) or [Alys Brett](mailto:Alys.Brett@ukaea.uk).

## Timeline

* 10th June - Deadline for submitting initial proposals
* 27th June - Notification of successful applicants
* July and August - Develop talk and write paper
