## International RSE Groups

**Research Software Engineering Groups provide a home for research programmers who collaborate with researchers on multiple research projects**

Most Research Software Engineers are employed as Research Associates on individual research projects. But we are particularly interested in the ways in which research organizations bring research programmers together into larger teams, and are trying to maintain a list of such groups here, not just [in the UK](/groups.html), but around the world.

These may be formal organizations, or looser federations. They may be based in universities or in national labs or research institutes, and in academic departments or in university IT organizations.

If your place of work meets the above definition, and is based outside of the UK, please [submit a pull request to this page](https://github.com/UKRSE/UKRSE.github.io/blob/master/international.md) to add it to the list.

We also maintain a [list of groups based in the UK](/groups.html).
