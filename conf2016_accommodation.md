Below are some hotels that have availability currently and are near to the venue. This isn’t an exhaustive list as there are many hotels in Manchester and you may find a cheaper deal further away from the venue. We don’t have any preferential rates with these hotels unfortunately. There are some excellent offers on [booking.com](http://booking.com) for these hotels, bringing some of the four and even five star hotels down to the same price as a 3 star hotel.

(Note that all prices are correct as of June 2016. These prices are likely to increase as we get closer to the date of the conference)
