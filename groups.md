## About RSE Groups

**Research Software Engineering Groups provide a home for research programmers who collaborate with researchers on multiple research projects**

Most Research Software Engineers are employed as Research Associates on individual research projects. But we are particularly interested in the ways in which research organisations bring research programmers together into larger teams, and are trying to maintain a list of such groups here, not just in the UK, but [around the world](/international.html).

These may be formal organisations (like the UCL group), or looser federations (like the Oxford group). They may be based in universities or in national labs or research institutes, and in academic departments or in university IT organisations.

UKRSE hosts an "RSE Leaders" subcomittee, a peer-support group for heads of research software engineering groups. If you run a research programming organisation, and would like to join, please get in touch.

If your place of work meets the above definition, please [submit a pull request to this page](https://github.com/UKRSE/UKRSE.github.io/blob/master/groups.md) to add it to the list.

If you are based outside the UK, please see our [list of international RSE groups](/international.html).
