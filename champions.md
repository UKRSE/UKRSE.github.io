## About Champions

**Champions are your local contact for the UK RSE community.**

If you can't see your place of work listed, and you'd like to help out, then please [submit a pull request to this page](https://github.com/UKRSE/UKRSE.github.io/blob/master/champions.md) with your details and we'll add you.

As a Champion we ask that you host a seminar for people at your organization about the practice of Research Software Engineering and UK RSE. You could give this talk yourself or ask another Champion to visit you.
