## About Champions

**Champions are your local contact for the UK RSE community.**

If you can't see your place of work listed, and you'd like to help out, then please [submit a pull request to this page](https://github.com/UKRSE/UKRSE.github.io/blob/master/champions.md) with your details and we'll add you.

As a Champion we ask that you host a seminar for people at your organization about the practice of Research Software Engineering and UK RSE. You could give this talk yourself or ask another Champion to visit you.

Discussion at UKRSE Network Meeting on 29th Jan:

1. What is the role of RSE Champion?
- Point of contacts for interested people
- Facilitating and helping with recruitment
- Help with job applications, career path advice
- Being a nucleus for helping RSE people to work with HR
- Working and contacting people in the industiral domain and corporate world: How do we get in touch with them?

2. How much is the workload?
- We don't know yet
- It is probably within the remit of RSE Fellows

3. How we want to publishing and promoting the role
- Wepage(s) which has /haven't gone public
- Webpage needs to clarify and provide information: Who provides the input to the webpages? Champions and the community
- There should be common material, core material and more specific material for each institution
- Example of case studies as selling point to new communities, RSE Champions could provide this
- Institutional newsletters
- Sharing proposals

4. Helping and engaging between the champions
- Giving mutual lectures and talks
- Mailing lists (?)

Points that came up in the general discussion:

- Email will be sent out to the mailing list informing about the launch of the RSE Champion list.
- Community will be encouraged to speak to their champion or become one themselves in case their institution is not listed.
- RSE Champion is promoting the role and the campaign, but not the institution.
